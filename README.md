The project has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed.
HF
====
An implementation of the Hartree-Fock method for atoms and molecules, based on McMurchie-Davidson scheme using Gaussian basis functions. The input basis files read by the code are in the Turbomole format. These files are taken from the website [Basis Set Exchange](https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal)


To compile the following libraries are needed:
- Armadillo
- Libconfig
- HDF5
- Boost

Editing of the code is best done using [QtCreator](http://qt-project.org/downloads).

Example of config file:
```
